hackathon #4 React. Flight API

- call REST API to fetch flights 
- Search bar. Enable user to select a destination from a dropdown and to select an origin (place of the departure) from a dropdown, to search flights from this date in format dd/mm/YYYY, until date in format dd/mm/YYYY, to choose the limit number of results
- add checkbox "direct flights only" - if a user of the application check it, then search only for direct flights
- show number of stopovers in the results - e.g. flying to Valencia from Prague with a stopover in Frankfurt means 1 stopover, direct flight to Valencia from Prague has 0 stopovers.
- enable user to fetch more than 5 flight - add pagination. Don't show "show more" button, if there are no more results
- show info that there are no flights available if no flights are found on the selected route.
